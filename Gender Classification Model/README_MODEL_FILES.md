# Gender Classification Model - Required Files

## Missing Model Files

This app requires the following model files to function:

1. **scaler.pkl** - StandardScaler for feature scaling
2. **pca.pkl** - PCA model for dimensionality reduction
3. **tuned_logistic_regression_model.pkl** - Trained logistic regression model

## How to Generate Model Files

The model files should be generated by training the model using the notebook:
- `Gender_Classification_Model.ipynb`

## Dependencies

The app also requires:
- **sentence-transformers** - For text embeddings
  ```bash
  pip install sentence-transformers
  ```

## Current Status

The app has been updated with error handling to gracefully handle missing model files.
When model files are missing, the app will show an error message instead of crashing.

## Running the App

```bash
cd "Gender Classification Model"
python app.py
```
